<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="/Assets/act.png" width="800" height="400">

Hospitals and other medical centres have facilities of keeping patients under medical attention to monitor their progress. The nurse carefully monitors the patients and takes necessary action in case of any unusual activity or sense of emergency. However, sometimes patients cannot afford this service as it’s expensive. If we have an automated system in place which tracks patient’s activity and informs concerned authorities to take immediate actions in case of emergency, then many people would be benefitted. This will incur camera installation and setting up of other logistics but would be still cheaper than human monitoring. Also, there are many instances of complications or even deaths in rehab centres because of no or delayed action in case of events like collapse, heart attack or seizures. This can be mitigated by having a 24*7 surveillance in place that recognizes an abnormality in patient’s behaviour and alerts respective authorities. We introduce a novel model in this paper to monitor patient activity using the CNN-LSTM model. <br/>

<!-- DATASET AND FEATURE EXTRACTION -->
## Dataset and Feature Extraction
<img src="/Assets/Activities.png" width="800" height="400">
Since it was difficult to get real data of a rehab center and then train the model for some specific events, we generated synthetic data using Unity3D. We divided the training data into two broad categories; Activities that are considered normal and those which are abnormal. </br>
<b>Normal activities:</b>Sitting, Standing, Walking ,Sleeping </br>
<b>Abnormal activities:</b>Falling, pain/coughing </br>
<img src="/Assets/keypoints.png" width="500" height="400">
We divide the simulations into frames for keypoint detection model. Further, the output from keypoint models are normalized to pass it on to activity detection model.
